# Input-placeholders

Basic jQuery plugin for adding placeholders in legacy browsers (IE9).

## Motivation

I needed a plugin without dependencies for my projects.

## Using it

Call the plugin by adding `$.fn.placeholder();` to your page. Also you can use the CSS as reference.

## Contributors

This is just a simple plugin for my personal projects and to practice my JS abilities. You're more than welcome to contribute :)
